The files in this directory are intended for creating minimalist installation
zips.

repack.c is a much smaller (but functionally equivalent) rewrite of the
AnyKernel installation method.  Rather than unpacking and repacking boot.img
files, it directly combines the relevant sections.  Its depends on bootimg.h
from AOSP (the included version is taken from CM, but should be unchanged).

tiny-vmin.c is a drop-in replacement for update-binary to adjust (or more
accurately, to replace) the minimum voltage initscript used by dkp.  It uses a
few tricks that aren't possible with Google's update-binary, and compiles into
a miniscule binary.

extractrd.c and injectrd.c are handy tools for manipulating the ramdisk in a
boot.img.  They're very small, very fast, and very simple.  "extractrd boot.img
>ramdisk.gz" dumps the ramdisk, "injectrd boot.img <ramdisk.gz" overwrites it.
